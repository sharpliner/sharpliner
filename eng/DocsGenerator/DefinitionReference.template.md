# Azure DevOps pipeline definition reference

Here you can find detailed reference on how to define various parts of the pipeline.

For a full list of classes you can override to create a YAML file, see [PublicDefinitions.cs](https://github.com/sharpliner/sharpliner/blob/main/src/Sharpliner/AzureDevOps/PublicDefinitions.cs).

## Build steps

Build steps are basic building blocks of the build.
Azure DevOps pipelines [define several basic tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/steps) that can be used as the pipeline's build steps:

- `script`
- `bash`
- `pwsh`
- `powerShell`
- `publish`
- `download`
- `checkout`
- `task`

For each of these, there are two ways how you can define these.

Either you "new" them the regular way though this requires a longer syntax similar to what you would do in YAML:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#classic-pipeline-steps)]

or you can use the shorthand style. For each of the basic commands, a method/property is defined on the parent class with the same name as the original task:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#shorthand-pipeline-steps)]

Please notice the `with` keyword which is a [new feature in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record#nondestructive-mutation) that allows modifying of records.

## Azure Pipelines tasks

Even though it is possible to use any of the non-default [Azure Pipelines tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/?view=azure-devops) by specifying its name + inputs:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#azure-pipeline-task)]

some of the tasks are quite hard to comprehend such as the [.NET Core CLI task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/dotnet-core-cli?view=azure-devops) whose specification is quite long since the task can do many different things.
Notice how some of the properties are only valid in a specific combination with other.
With Sharpliner, we remove some of this complexity by restricting which properties are available at a time and by using nice fluent APIs for dotnet and similar complex tasks.

*Note how we use the `with` keyword to extend the `record` object with new properties.*

### Dotnet

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#dotnet-tasks)]

### NuGet

The [NuGet v2 task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2?view=azure-pipelines) also has multiple combinations based on the command.

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#nuget-tasks-code)]

Generated YAML:

[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#nuget-tasks-yaml)]

### Contributions welcome

Currently, we don't support many marketplace tasks in C# as the project is still growing.
If you find one useful, hit us up with a request, or better, with a pull request and we can add it to our library.

## Pipeline variables

Similarly to Build steps, there's a shorthand style of definition of variables too:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#pipeline-variables)]

You can define variables and pass them to methods to make the code more readable:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#pipeline-variables-readable)]

## Pipeline parameters
To define [pipeline runtime parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/runtime-parameters?view=azure-devops&tabs=script), utilize the `*Parameter` shorthands:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#pipeline-parameters)]

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#enum-definition)]

When referencing these parameters, you can just refer to the parameter and it will be replaced with a parameter reference expression:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#pipeline-parameters-readable)]

See more examples in the [test class](../../tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/TemplateTests.cs#49)

## Conditioned expressions

The Azure DevOps pipeline YAML allows you to specify conditioned expressions which are evaulated when pipeline is started.
Sharpliner allows to define conditioned blocks as well in almost any part of the definition.
If you find a place where If cannot be used, raise an issue and we can add it easily.

This feature was a little bit problematic to mimic in C# but we've found a nice way to express these:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#conditioned-expressions-code)]

The resulting YAML will look like this:

[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#conditioned-expressions-yaml)]

You can also specify conditions in places like template parameters (which are improved dictionaries really):

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#template-conditioned-expressions-code)]

This will produce following YAML:

[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#template-conditioned-expressions-yaml)]

### Conditions

The conditions themselves are defined similarly to what Azure DevOps requires, so this example YAML condition:
[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#conditions-yaml)]

would have this C# definition:
[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#conditions-code)]

The logic operators such as `Equal` or `Or` expect either a string or a nested condition.
Additionally, you can also use `variables["name"]` instead of `"variables[\"name\"]"` as shorthand notation but it has the same effect.

Finally, many of the commonly used conditions have macros prepared for a shorter syntax.
These are:
[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#conditions-macros)]

## Each expression

The `${{ each var in collection }}` expression is also supported. Similarly to `If` and `EndIf`, you can use `Each` and `EndEach`:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#each-expression-code)]

generates the following YAML:

[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#each-expression-yaml)]

## Templates

Azure pipelines allow you to [define a parametrized template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema#template-references) for a **stage**, **job**, **step** or **variables** and then insert those templates in your pipeline.
Sharpliner also supports definition and refercing of templates, however with C# it's easier to define these entities directly in code.
Anyway, the functionality is useful when for example migrating from large YAML code base step by step.
We also found it useful to create both YAML templates + C# representations for calling them and bind their parameters this way.

To define a template, you do it similarly as when you define the pipeline - you inherit from one of these classes:

- `StageTemplateDefinition`
- `JobTemplateDefinition`
- `StepTemplateDefinition`
- `VariableTemplateDefinition`

Additionally, Sharpliner allows to define a type for the template parameters so that usage of your own template is compile-time type-safe.
In such case, you inherit from the generic versions of these classes:

- `StageTemplateDefinition<TParameters>`
- `JobTemplateDefinition<TParameters>`
- `StepTemplateDefinition<TParameters>`
- `VariableTemplateDefinition<TParameters>`

Example usage:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#strongly-typed-parameters-code)]

Which produces following YAML template:

[!code-yaml[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#strongly-typed-parameters-yaml)]

You can also define a template without stong-typing the parameters:

[!code-csharp[](tests/Sharpliner.Tests/AzureDevOps/Docs/DefinitionReferenceTests.cs#untyped-parameters-template)]

To use the template, reference it in the following way:

```csharp
// The strong-typed version
Steps =
[
    new InstallDotNetTemplate(new()
    {
        Project = "src/MyProject.csproj",
        Version = "5.0.100",
    })
]

// The non-strong-typed version (second example of the InstallDotNet definition)
Steps =
[
    StepTemplate("pipelines/install-dotnet.yml", new()
    {
        { "project", "src/MyProject.csproj" },
        { "version", "5.0.100" },
    })
]
```

## Definition libraries

Sharpliner lets you re-use code more easily than YAML templates do.
Apart from obvious C# code re-use, you can also define sets of C# building blocks and re-use them in your pipelines:

```csharp
class ProjectBuildSteps : StepLibrary
{
    public override List<Conditioned<Step>> Steps =>
    [
        DotNet.Install.Sdk("6.0.100"),

        If.IsBranch("main")
            .Step(DotNet.Restore.Projects("src/MyProject.sln")),

        DotNet.Build("src/MyProject.sln"),
    ];
}
```

You can then reference this library in between build steps and it will get expanded into the pipeline's YAML:

```csharp
new Job("Build")
{
    Steps =
    [
        Script.Inline("echo 'Hello World'"),

        StepLibrary<ProjectBuildSteps>(),

        Script.Inline("echo 'Goodbye World'"),
    ]
}
```
