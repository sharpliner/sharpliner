    //
    // var cr = new CheckRun {
    //     Activities = { Created, Requested }
    // }
    //
    // we will have to wait until c# does implement the feature, so for the time

    //
    // var cr = new CheckRun {
    //     Activities = { CheckRun.Activity.Created, CheckRun.Activity.Requested }
    // }
    //
    // verbose, but type safe and autocomplete will help. If not, get a better editor!
